## Statistics 101
#### **Measures of Central Tendency and Data Dispersion**
The first stage of any machine learning project is to explore the data, and a crucial part of that exploration is understanding the measures of central tendency and dispersion. 

It's always a good idea to summarize the data by means of graphs:
* For *nominal/ordinal* data, i.e. colors of the rainbow, types of animals, and political affiliations or grades in school (A, B, C, D, F), customer satisfaction ratings (very satisfied, satisfied, neutral, dissatisfied, very dissatisfied), and clothing sizes (small, medium, large) -> bar graph.
* For *interval ratio varibale* (numeric data such house price) -> histogram.

Assessing the shape of a distribution is of essential importance because it could effect the statistical methods that we can employ. 

Besides summarizing data by charts, it's useful to describe the center of a distribution. **Measures of central tendency**, such as the *mean*, *median*, and *mode*, provide insight into the "center" of a dataset in which:
* **Mode**: The mode is the most frequently occurring value in a dataset. It can be calculated by simply counting the number of times each value appears in the dataset and finding the value with the highest count.

* **Mean**: The mean is the average value of a dataset. It can be calculated by summing up all the values in the dataset and dividing by the total number of values.
```
Mean = (sum of all values) / (total number of values)
```
* **Median**: The median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. It can be calculated by finding the value that separates the dataset into two equal halves. For an odd number of values in the dataset, the median is the middle value. For an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values. 
Understanding these measures is important for machine learning applications because they help us identify trends and patterns in the data. For example, if we are analyzing customer behavior data, we might use the mean to understand the average amount of time customers spend on our website. We might use the standard deviation to determine how much the time spent varies from the mean and to identify any outliers in the data. 

To adequately describe a distribution, we also need to explore the variability or dispersion of data via **Measures of dispersion**, including *range*, *interquartile range*, *variance*, and *standard deviation* in which
* **Range**: The range is the difference between the highest and the lowest value in a dataset. It provides a measure of how spread out the data is.
```
Range = max(x) - min(x)
```

* **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: The IQR is the range of the middle 50% of the dataset, which is the difference between the third quartile (75th percentile) and the first quartile (25th percentile). It is less affected by extreme values than the range and provides a measure of the spread of the central part of the data.
```
Interquartile Range (IQR) = Q3 - Q1, where Q1 is the first quartile (25th percentile) and Q3 is the third quartile (75th percentile)
```

* **Variance**: The variance is a measure of how much the data deviates from its mean. It is calculated by finding the average of the squared differences between each value and the mean. A higher variance indicates that the data is more spread out.
```
Variance = (1/n) * Σ(xi - x̄)^2, where n is the number of observations, Σ is the sum of, xi is the i-th observation, and x̄ is the sample mean.
```

* **Standard Deviation**: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance and is commonly used to measure the spread of data in a normal distribution. It provides a measure of how much the data deviates from its mean in the same unit of measurement as the data. A higher standard deviation indicates that the data is more spread out.
```
Standard Deviation = sqrt(1/n * Σ(xi - x̄)^2), where sqrt denotes the square root and all the other symbols are the same as in the variance formula.
```

One useful tool in a data scientist's tool box is **Box plots** which are an essential tool for visualizing the measures of central tendency and dispersion. They offer a simple way to compare multiple datasets and identify differences between them, making it easy to spot outliers. By analyzing the quartiles of data based on the median, box plots can provide insights into the data's characteristics and identify potential problems. For example, suppose we are analyzing the performance of two different machine learning models. We can use a box plot to compare the accuracy scores of the two models. If the box plot shows that the median score of the first model is higher than the second model, we can conclude that the first model performs better. If the box plot shows that the second model has a wider range, we can investigate further to identify any outliers or potential issues with the data.

![This is a box plot.](/assets/images/boxplot.png "This is a box plot.")

It should pay attention that the the area below the median is greater than the area above the median line in a box plot. It means that the lower half of the data set is more spread out than the upper half of the data set. This can happen when the distribution of the data is skewed, with a longer tail on one side of the median than the other. The box plot shows the quartiles of the data, which are based on the median, so if the data is skewed, the lower quartile (Q1) and upper quartile (Q3) may be closer together on one side of the median than the other. This can result in a longer box on one side of the median and a shorter box on the other side, with more outliers on the longer side. In general, if the area below the median is much greater than the area above the median line in a box plot, it suggests that there is more variability in the lower half of the data set than in the upper half. However, the exact interpretation depends on the shape of the distribution and the nature of the data being analyzed.

## Data Mining
#### **Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM)** - Genralist friendly version
![This is the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining diagram.](/assets/images/CRISP-DM.png "This is the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining diagram.")

Data mining is an intricate process that combines science, technology, and art to solve complex problems. This process follows a structured approach to ensure consistency, repeatability, and objectivity. It involves several stages that are iterative, meaning that they may need to be repeated until the problem is solved.

The first stage is **business understanding**, where analysts need to understand the problem that needs to be solved. This stage requires creativity as the business problem needs to be cast as one or more data science problems. Data scientists need to have high-level knowledge to see novel formulations.

The next stage is **data understanding**, where analysts need to understand the available raw material or data to build a solution. Data may have strengths and limitations, and it's essential to estimate the costs and benefits of each data source. Data collation may also require additional effort.

**Data preparation** is another crucial stage where data are manipulated and converted into forms that yield better results. Data mining techniques have certain requirements that may require data to be in a different form than how it is naturally provided. For example, converting data to tabular format, removing or inferring missing values, and converting data to different types. During data preparation, it's essential to beware of "leaks" that may give information on the target variable that's not actually available when the decision needs to be made.

The **modeling** stage is where data mining techniques are applied to the data to capture regularities in the data and develop models based on algorithms such as decision trees, neural networks, or association rules. Different algorithms may be better suited for different types of data and applications.

The **evaluation** stage is crucial to assess data mining results rigorously and gain confidence that they are valid and reliable. Models need to be tested in a controlled laboratory setting before deployment. Various stakeholders have interests in the business decision-making that will be accomplished or supported by the resultant models, and they need to sign off on the deployment of the models.

The **deployment** stage refers to integrating a model or solution into a production environment. One important consideration is that the environment it will operate in may be different from the environment it was developed in, leading to discrepancies in performance. Ongoing monitoring and maintenance are also necessary to ensure continued accuracy, as models can suffer from drift as data patterns change over time. It's crucial to evaluate the ethical implications of deploying a model or solution carefully.

For example, suppose a model is trained on data collected from a specific region to predict the likelihood of loan defaults. In that case, it may not perform as well when deployed in a different region due to variations in demographics and economic conditions. Also, suppose the model is used to make loan approval decisions, and it's found to be biased against a particular race or gender. In that case, it's important to evaluate the potential impact of the model before deploying it in a production environment. The model's behavior needs to be made comprehensible to stakeholders, and the ethical implications of its deployment should be carefully considered.

#### **Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM)** - Detailed version
![This is the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining diagram.](/assets/images/CRISP-DM.png "This is the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining diagram.")

Data mining is a complex process that involves the application of science, technology, and art. There is a well-understood process that places a structure on the problem, allowing for consistency, repeatability, and objectiveness. The process diagram shows that iteration is the rule rather than the exception, as going through the process once without solving the problem is generally not a failure. The steps involved in data mining are discussed below:


**Business Understanding**
The first step in data mining is to understand the problem that needs to be solved. Often, business projects are not clear and unambiguous data mining problems, so recasting the problem and designing a solution is an iterative process of discovery. The business understanding stage involves creativity from the analysts, as they need to cast the business problem as one or more data science problems. High-level knowledge of the fundamentals helps creative business analysts see novel formulations.


**Data Understanding**
The data comprise the available raw material from which the solution will be built. It is important to understand the strengths and limitations of the data because rarely is there an exact match with the problem. The costs of data can vary, and a critical part of the data understanding phase is estimating the costs and benefits of each data source and deciding whether further investment is merited. Even after all datasets are acquired, collating them may require additional effort.


**Data Preparation**
Data preparation is a crucial stage of the data mining process where data are manipulated and converted into forms that yield better results. Data mining techniques impose certain requirements on the data they use, and often require data to be in a form different from how the data are provided naturally. Typical examples of data preparation include converting data to tabular format, removing or inferring missing values, and converting data to different types.

Some data mining techniques are designed for symbolic and categorical data, while others handle only numeric values. In addition, numerical values must often be normalized or scaled so that they are comparable. Standard techniques and rules of thumb are available for doing such conversions.

One very general and important concern during data preparation is to beware of "leaks." A leak is a situation where a variable collected in historical data gives information on the target variable, information that appears in historical data but is not actually available when the decision has to be made. Leakage must be considered carefully during data preparation because it typically is performed after the fact—from historical data.


**Modeling**
The modeling stage is the primary place where data mining techniques are applied to the data. It is important to have some understanding of the fundamental ideas of data mining, including the sorts of techniques and algorithms that exist, because this is the part of the craft where the most science and technology can be brought to bear.

The output of modeling is some sort of model or pattern capturing regularities in the data. Models can be based on many types of algorithms, such as decision trees, neural networks, or association rules. Each algorithm has strengths and weaknesses, and different algorithms may be better suited for different types of data and applications.


**Evaluation**
The purpose of the evaluation stage is to assess the data mining results rigorously and to gain confidence that they are valid and reliable before moving on. It is possible to deploy results immediately after data mining, but this is inadvisable; it is usually far easier, cheaper, quicker, and safer to test a model first in a controlled laboratory setting.

The evaluation stage also serves to help ensure that the model satisfies the original business goals. Usually, a data mining solution is only a piece of the larger solution, and it needs to be evaluated as such. Evaluating the results of data mining includes both quantitative and qualitative assessments. Various stakeholders have interests in the business decision-making that will be accomplished or supported by the resultant models.

In many cases, these stakeholders need to "sign off" on the deployment of the models and need to be satisfied by the quality of the model's decisions. To facilitate such qualitative assessment, the data scientist must think about the comprehensibility of the model to stakeholders (not just to the data scientists). If the model itself is not comprehensible (e.g., maybe the model is a very complex mathematical formula), the data scientists need to work to make the behavior of the model comprehensible.


**Deployment**
Deployment refers to the process of integrating a model or solution into a production environment. This can involve putting a predictive model into operation within an information system, or deploying a data-driven decision making process into a business operation.

One important consideration in deploying a model is that the environment it will operate in may be different from the environment it was developed in. This can lead to discrepancies in performance, and the need for recalibration or adjustment of the model. For example, a model trained on data collected from a specific region may not perform as well when deployed in a different region. Another important aspect of deployment is ongoing monitoring and maintenance. Models can suffer from "drift" as data patterns change over time, and periodic recalibration or retraining may be necessary to ensure continued accuracy.

Finally, it is important to consider the ethical implications of deploying a model or solution. Data-driven decision making can have unintended consequences, and it is important to carefully evaluate the potential impact of a model before deploying it in a production environment.

* The model's performance on the test set provides an unbiased estimate of how well the model will perform on new data.

12. **Interpretation**
* After building a model, it is important to understand how it is making predictions. This can be done by analyzing the model's feature importance, decision boundaries, and activation maps.

* Consider using containerization technologies such as Docker to make deployment easier and more efficient.

14. **Monitoring**
* After the model is deployed, it is important to monitor its performance to ensure it continues to perform well. Monitoring involves tracking the model's performance metrics and making adjustments as needed. If the model's performance starts to degrade, it may be necessary to retrain the model on new data or update its hyperparameters. 
* Consider setting up alerts or triggers to notify stakeholders if the model's performance starts to degrade.

15. **Maintenance**
* As new data becomes available or as the environment changes, it may be necessary to update the model to ensure it continues to provide accurate predictions. Maintenance involves updating the model's training data, retraining the model, and updating its hyperparameters as needed. It is important to regularly evaluate the model's performance and make adjustments to ensure it remains accurate and relevant over time.

* Identify which features have the most significant impact on the outcome variable. 
* Use techniques such as feature importance, partial dependence plots, or permutation feature importance to interpret the model's behaviour. 
* Consider using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), which provides a unified framework for interpreting the output of any machine learning model. SHAP values explain the output of any model by computing the contribution of each feature to the prediction. 
* Visualize the results to communicate the findings effectively. Present the results in a way that is easily understandable to stakeholders and decision-makers.

* Once the model is developed and tested, the next step is to deploy it into production. 
* Consider the infrastructure requirements for deploying the model, such as computing resources, storage, and network bandwidth. 
* Ensure that the model's performance meets the business requirements and monitor its performance regularly. 
* Develop a plan for maintaining and updating the model to ensure that it remains accurate and relevant over time.
* Consider ethical and legal implications of deploying the model and ensure that it meets ethical and regulatory guidelines.

14. **Monitoring**
* Once the model is deployed, it is important to monitor its performance over time. 
* Monitor the inputs and outputs to ensure that they are consistent with the training data. 
* Check for any data drift or concept drift, which occurs when the statistical properties of the input data change over time, leading to a decrease in the model's performance. 
* Use techniques such as statistical process control, anomaly detection, or change detection to identify any issues and take corrective actions.

15. **Maintenance**
* Maintain the model by periodically retraining it on new data or updating it with new features or hyperparameters.
* Consider the ongoing costs and benefits of maintaining the model compared to redeveloping it from scratch.
* Ensure that the model is still aligned with the business objectives and that the assumptions made during the development process are still valid.
* Document any changes or updates to the model and its associated processes and workflows.
