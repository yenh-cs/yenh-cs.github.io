### Measures of Central Tendency and Data Dispersion
The first stage of any machine learning project is to explore the data, and a crucial part of that exploration is understanding the measures of central tendency and dispersion. 

It's always a good idea to summarize the data by means of graphs:
* For *nominal/ordinal* data, i.e. colors of the rainbow, types of animals, and political affiliations or grades in school (A, B, C, D, F), customer satisfaction ratings (very satisfied, satisfied, neutral, dissatisfied, very dissatisfied), and clothing sizes (small, medium, large) -> bar graph.
* For *interval ratio varibale* (numeric data such house price) -> histogram.

Assessing the shape of a distribution is of essential importance because it could effect the statistical methods that we can employ. 

Besides summarizing data by charts, it's useful to describe the center of a distribution. **Measures of central tendency**, such as the *mean*, *median*, and *mode*, provide insight into the "center" of a dataset in which:
* **Mode**: The mode is the most frequently occurring value in a dataset. It can be calculated by simply counting the number of times each value appears in the dataset and finding the value with the highest count.

* **Mean**: The mean is the average value of a dataset. It can be calculated by summing up all the values in the dataset and dividing by the total number of values.
```
Mean = (sum of all values) / (total number of values)
```
* **Median**: The median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. It can be calculated by finding the value that separates the dataset into two equal halves. For an odd number of values in the dataset, the median is the middle value. For an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values. 
Understanding these measures is important for machine learning applications because they help us identify trends and patterns in the data. For example, if we are analyzing customer behavior data, we might use the mean to understand the average amount of time customers spend on our website. We might use the standard deviation to determine how much the time spent varies from the mean and to identify any outliers in the data. 

To adequately describe a distribution, we also need to explore the variability or dispersion of data via **Measures of dispersion**, including *range*, *interquartile range*, *variance*, and *standard deviation* in which
* **Range**: The range is the difference between the highest and the lowest value in a dataset. It provides a measure of how spread out the data is.
```
Range = max(x) - min(x)
```

* **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: The IQR is the range of the middle 50% of the dataset, which is the difference between the third quartile (75th percentile) and the first quartile (25th percentile). It is less affected by extreme values than the range and provides a measure of the spread of the central part of the data.
```
Interquartile Range (IQR) = Q3 - Q1, where Q1 is the first quartile (25th percentile) and Q3 is the third quartile (75th percentile)
```

* **Variance**: The variance is a measure of how much the data deviates from its mean. It is calculated by finding the average of the squared differences between each value and the mean. A higher variance indicates that the data is more spread out.
```
Variance = (1/n) * Σ(xi - x̄)^2, where n is the number of observations, Σ is the sum of, xi is the i-th observation, and x̄ is the sample mean.
```

* **Standard Deviation**: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance and is commonly used to measure the spread of data in a normal distribution. It provides a measure of how much the data deviates from its mean in the same unit of measurement as the data. A higher standard deviation indicates that the data is more spread out.
```
Standard Deviation = sqrt(1/n * Σ(xi - x̄)^2), where sqrt denotes the square root and all the other symbols are the same as in the variance formula.
```

One useful tool in a data scientist's tool box is **Box plots** which are an essential tool for visualizing the measures of central tendency and dispersion. They offer a simple way to compare multiple datasets and identify differences between them, making it easy to spot outliers. By analyzing the quartiles of data based on the median, box plots can provide insights into the data's characteristics and identify potential problems. For example, suppose we are analyzing the performance of two different machine learning models. We can use a box plot to compare the accuracy scores of the two models. If the box plot shows that the median score of the first model is higher than the second model, we can conclude that the first model performs better. If the box plot shows that the second model has a wider range, we can investigate further to identify any outliers or potential issues with the data.

It should pay attention that the the area below the median is greater than the area above the median line in a box plot. It means that the lower half of the data set is more spread out than the upper half of the data set. This can happen when the distribution of the data is skewed, with a longer tail on one side of the median than the other. The box plot shows the quartiles of the data, which are based on the median, so if the data is skewed, the lower quartile (Q1) and upper quartile (Q3) may be closer together on one side of the median than the other. This can result in a longer box on one side of the median and a shorter box on the other side, with more outliers on the longer side. In general, if the area below the median is much greater than the area above the median line in a box plot, it suggests that there is more variability in the lower half of the data set than in the upper half. However, the exact interpretation depends on the shape of the distribution and the nature of the data being analyzed.
